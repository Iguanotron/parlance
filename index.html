<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
The Parlance Language is an open-source, C-based language designed for accessibility. 
The language is defined to be as close to natural language as possible, in order that 
it can be easily recognized by speech-to-text applications. It uses an easy-to-learn, 
natural language scheme focused on readability and ease of parsing. In its current form,
Parlance is converted to standard ANSI C code by the C Preprocessor
