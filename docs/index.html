<h1>Parlance - Accessible Programming</h1>
<p>Readable. Speakable. Powerful.</p>
</header>

<div id="content">
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Right now, there is a severe lack of truly accessible options for programmers with
physical disabilities. If you can't type, you basically can't code--but we hope to
change that.</p>
<p>Modern and old-fashioned languages alike tend to be very symbol-heavy. Even languages
that seem very close to natural language (like Python) often rely on strict formatting
rules to function, which isn't feasible for people with screen readers, or anyone who
operates computers with speech-recognition tools.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Parlance language is an open-source, C-based language designed for accessibility. 
Parlance's syntax is as close to natural language as possible, so that it can be easily
recognized by speech-to-text applications. It uses an easy-to-learn set of dictionary
words to build a true, powerful programming language focused on readability and
speakability. Parlance is directly converted to standard ANSI C code, so users who know
C can easily begin using Parlance.</p>
<h2>Current Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Turing complete</li>
  <li>Unambiguous formatting</li>
  <li>Compiles directly to C code</li>
  <li>Easy to understand when read aloud</li>
  <li>Easy to learn with a foundation in C or its relatives</li>
  <li>Potential for easy speech-to-text and/or text-to-speech integration</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comparison to C</h2>

<h3>C Code:</h3>
<p><pre><code class="code-block">#include <span class="c-literal">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="c-type">int</span> main() 
{
	printf(<span class="c-literal">&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;</span>);
	return <span class="c-literal">0</span>;	
}
</code></pre></p>

<h3>Equivalent Parlance Code:</h3>
<p><pre><code class="code-block">CPP INCLUDE <span class="c-literal">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

DECLARE FUNCTION <span class="c-type">main</span> TYPE <span class="c-type">int</span>	
BEGIN
	CALL <span class="c-type">printf</span>
		ARG LITERAL STRING <span class="c-literal">&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;</span> END LITERAL
	END CALL END STATEMENT
	RETURN LITERAL INT <span class="c-literal">0</span> END LITERAL END STATEMENT
END SCOPE
END
</code></pre></p>

<h2> FizzBuzz in Parlance:</h2>
<p><pre><code class="code-block">CPP INCLUDE <span class="c-literal">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

DECLARE FUNCTION <span class="c-type">main</span> TYPE <span class="c-type">int</span>

LOOP 
	FIRST VARIABLE <span class="c-type">i</span> GETS LITERAL INT <span class="c-literal">1</span> END LITERAL
	CONDITION VARIABLE <span class="c-type">i</span> LESSTHAN LITERAL INT <span class="c-literal">101</span> END LITERAL

	IF VARIABLE <span class="c-type">i</span> MODULO LITERAL INT <span class="c-literal">3</span> END LITERAL EQUALS LITERAL INT <span class="c-literal">0</span> END LITERAL AND 
	   VARIABLE <span class="c-type">i</span> MODULO LITERAL INT <span class="c-literal">5</span> END LITERAL EQUALS LITERAL INT <span class="c-literal">0</span> END LITERAL
	BEGIN
       	CALL <span class="c-type">printf</span> 
       		ARG LITERAL STRING <span class="c-literal">"FizzBuzz"</span> END LITERAL 
       	END CALL END STATEMENT
	END SCOPE

	ELSE IF VARIABLE <span class="c-type">i</span> MODULO LITERAL INT <span class="c-literal">3</span> END LITERAL EQUALS LITERAL INT <span class="c-literal">0</span> END LITERAL
	BEGIN
       	CALL <span class="c-type">printf</span> 
       		ARG LITERAL STRING <span class="c-literal">"Fizz"</span> END LITERAL 
       	END CALL END STATEMENT
	END SCOPE

	BEGIN
       	CALL <span class="c-type">printf</span> 
       		ARG LITERAL STRING <span class="c-literal">"Buzz"</span> END LITERAL 
       	END CALL END STATEMENT
	END SCOPE

	ELSE
	BEGIN
       	CALL <span class="c-type">printf</span> 
       		ARG LITERAL STRING <span class="c-literal">"%d"</span> END LITERAL ARG VARIABLE <span class="c-type">i</span>
