<h1>Parlance - Accessible Programming</h1>
</header>

<div id="content">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Parlance Language is an open-source, C-based language designed for accessibility. 
The language is defined to be as close to natural language as possible, in order that 
it can be easily recognized by speech-to-text applications. It uses an easy-to-learn, 
natural language scheme focused on readability and speakability. In its current form,
Parlance is directly converted to standard ANSI C code, so users who know C can easily
begin using Parlance.
</p>
<h2>Current Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Turing complete</li>
  <li>Unambiguous formatting</li>
  <li>Compiles directly to C code</li>
  <li>Easy to understand when read aloud</li>
  <li>Easy to learn with a foundation in C or its relatives</li>
  <li>Potential for easy speech-to-text and/or text-to-speech integration</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comparison to C</h2>

<h3>C Code:</h3>
<p><pre><code class="code-block">#include <span class="c-literal">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="c-type">int</span> main() 
{
	printf(</span class="c-literal">&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;</span>);
	return <span class="c-literal">0</span>;	
}
</code></pre></p>

<h3>Equivalent Parlance Code:</h3>
<p><pre><code class="code-block">CPP INCLUDE <span class="c-literal">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

DECLARE FUNCTION <span class="c-type">main</span> TYPE <span class="c-type">int</span>	
BEGIN
	CALL <span class="c-type">printf</span>
		ARG LITERAL STRING <span class="c-literal">&quot;Hello world!\n&quot;</span> END LITERAL
	END CALL END STATEMENT
	RETURN LITERAL INT <span class="c-literal">0</span> END LITERAL END STATEMENT
END SCOPE
END
</code></pre></p>
